# A/B Tests Project

## 1.	Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

**Two Versions**   
We will be comparing our new supplement, against our existing supplement product that claims to help people sleep better.  The new supplement is the “control version”/treatment.  

**A sample**  
We will be working with two user groups that are very similar in characteristics to the population, in age, gender, and demographics.  The sample populations will be selected at random.

**A hypothesis**  
I expect for the sampled population in the experiment to have a better night sleep than with the previous supplement.

**Outcome**  
I expect people taking the new supplement, will feel more rested 15% more of the time, than with the previous supplement.  We can measure the number of hours they woke up during the night as the reference point.

**Other measured variables**   
We will use 2 control groups of the same size, and with the same demographics as the master population.

## 2.	Will new uniforms help a gym’s business?

**Two Versions**  
We will be working with a multi-site gym.  In one gym, we will be keeping the current uniforms, the “control version”.  In another facility, the treatment, we will be designing a more stylish uniform for the employees.
 
**A sample**  
We will sample customers at each gym with a survey, that once they complete, they will receive 10% off of next month’s gym fees.  We will pick the sample groups randomly, and expect the random process to find a correct representation.

**A hypothesis**  
We expect this to have no effect on the gym’s business.

**Outcome**  
We have really no way to measure the outcome of changing staff uniforms.

**Other measured variables**  
None to mention.

## 3.	Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

**Two Versions**  
We plan to have 2 versions of the web page, that is displayed randomly, 50% of the time to the old web page, and 50% to the new web page.  We will save cookies as to which version of the web page to render.
 
**A sample**  
We will sample 2 control groups, that are based on their user id, and this will be stored in the browsers cookies.  Not all users will go to the new web page.  We will sample the users that go to the new web page, as well as a representative sample, equal in number, and similar customer characteristics.

**A hypothesis**  
We expect to have more interest, and longer browsing times with the new web design.

**Outcome**  
It is planned that customers will spend 9% more time on the new web page design, resulting in more business.

**Other measured variables**  

## 4.	If I put ‘please read’ in the e-mail subject will more people read my e-mails?

**Two Versions**  
 We plan to send out 2 groups of e-mails promotions, one of which will include ‘Please Read’ in the subject line, and the other as normally labeled previously.
 
**A sample**  
We will sample 2 representative groups, that are picked at random, of 20 users, and we will store the campaign information in our campaign database.

**A hypothesis**  
We should see a higher open rate using the ‘Please Read’ formatting of the subject line in the e-mails.

**Outcome**  
We expect to get a 12% increase in the opened e-mails addressed with ‘Please Read’, versus the standard e-mail format.

**Other measured variables**  
None
