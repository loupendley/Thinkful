## Challenge: Evaluate an experimental analysis

Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used. 
  
**Analysis:**  
1. Selection Bias:  The 2 sample populations were captured, and not randomly selected.  Perhaps they are inferior droids, and are not representative of the droid population.  In addition, the candidates are under duress, and under the control of their enemy, and we cannot expect anything of value to come of the campaign.
1. Bias in assignment to conditions:  We have no way of know if the two groups are similar to one another.  We must assume that they are not.
1. Observer bias:  These are captured droids, under the control of their enemy, and we cannot expect for them to succumb to any slogan, delivered by these evil rulers.  Expecting anything other than normal should be the expectation.
  

In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.
  
**Analysis:** 
1. Bias in assignment:  Four friendly planets for one group, and four unfriendly planets are not a good representations from which to compare.  If they were both friendly, then it could be the basis for a comparison, but the unfriendly could be under duress, or the fear of the group attacking them.  
1. Selection bias:  What was the method for selecting the people to survey, and were they representative between the two?  Since one group was unfriendly, it is almost certain that they were not that willing to participate in the survey.  This in addition to them being Jedi with special powers to potentially use to influence the survey is a definite bias.  
   
A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.
  
**Analysis:** 
1. Bias in assignment:  This fails in several points:
    1. Comparing Human Resources satisfaction rates with Information Technology workers is not a valid comparison.  The two groups are very different, work differently, interact differently, and have a completely different skill set.
    1. Comparing workers in different countries is another assignment bias - they may be totally different in so many ways, culture, language, religion, local customs, that this could be another problem with which to contend.
    1. The other source of bias could be from the fact that Human Resources tends to work at corporate, and the IT works could be at customer sites, or in remote call centers is an issue.  
   
When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.
  
**Analysis:** 
1. Sampling bias:  This campaign poses a large sampling bias.  It limits the users to people that:  1.  Are willing to use a bit of technology, and 2.  Are willing to do become physically active.  This is going to be a very limited group of people, as they need to be willing, or at least be active enough physically, and technologically savvy, and public enough to share this with an outside company, yet another privacy issue, PII, and potentially HIPAA compliance issues.
1. Bias in assignment:  We have no way of knowing if any of the members of the program are similar in any other way to another group.
1. Bias in setting:  People that sign up to use a fitness tracker, may change their behavior, to look better physically than they were previously.  This may cause them to change their behavior, in which case, the environment for the survey has changed.
   
To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.
