### The Research Proposal
#### Potential experiment dataset:  Happy Days Fitness App  

#### **The Problem:**
1. The big question:  **How can we provide a healthier working environment for our employees, and incentivize them?**
1. Employees are suffering from health issues at an alarming rate, working at a desk daily, and sometimes getting little to no exercise.  In addition long commute times to and from work can cause health issues, especially with deadlines and projects that necessitate overtime on the staff.  
1. Many employees complain about the high cost of the health insurance that the company has to offer.  The company is saddled with having to offer health and life insurance to employees with little incentive to live a healthier lifestyle.

#### **The Potential Solution**
Provide the employees with the option to wear a FitBit activity training band that will track their physical activity level.  This could allow the company to provide them with credits on their health and life insurance policies during annual enrollment.  The company could provide them with a FitBit band, along with an account to track their activity levels, and upon reaching different levels, provide them with some valuable monetary incentives.  This could help out the employee, and lessen the risk for the company, and provide for a happier employee.  The staff do not connect during business hours, and this could give them the opportunity to reconnect with each other perhaps on walks or runs to build stronger relationships, and build muscle.  

#### **The Method of testing the solution**  
Following these steps, this could be a huge success:
1.  Provide all employees the chance to participate in the progrm:
    1.  Receive a FitBit tracking device
    1.  Company sponsored FitBit account
    1.  Request employees to wear the Fitbit for the first month, and change nothing in their activity level.  This would be the before picture of their health.  Inform the employees of this so that they understand it is in their best interest to not change their health habits during this month.  This would be the A component of the A/B test.
    1.  Set the no-activity-change period as the employee benchmark.  
    1.  We will track the number of employees that have cardio fitness levels improve in the first 3 months.  This would be the B component of the A/B test.
          1.  If 20% of the employees improve their cardio fitness by at least 1 level, then the plan will be a success.
          1.  If the cardio fitness levels do not meet this criteria, we will abandon this plan, and reformulate another strategy.
