##  Assignment:
For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.

1.  You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May. 
**Design**: You really should run this campaign during the summer months, so to compare similar interest levels of bathing suit season.
**Assumptions**: The group that received the Feb and May e-mail were randomly selected from the population.  
**Bias**:    
    1.  Selection bias - the February group may not be thinking ahead to summer and bathing suites, where as the May group could be more interested.
    1.  Bias from study context or settings - the May group could be too busy reading e-mails, due to soon to be summer barbecues, and warmer weather.

1.  You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.  
**Bias**:     
    1.  Bias in assignment to condition - it could be that the sampling of the population was not of sufficient size to determine the rate of anxiety of the population.
    1.  Sampling bias - bad sample taken of the population.
    
1.  You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.  
**Bias**:    
    1.  Sampling bias - was there any other environmental or business event, that could explain the uptake of traffic, unrelated to the campaign?  Was it a sports or event weekend, that could be skewing the results?
    1.  Bias in assignment to condition - was the campaign promoted in any way to skew the results?
    
1.  You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.  
**Bias**:    
    1.  Selection bias - are you comparing the visits to this same time last year, as there could be some seasonal variation for the loyalty program.
    1.  Bias from study - what time of the year was the loyalty program starting?  During the winter months, like November - January, where you may see no change due to the seasonality.
