Drill: More clusters?

Your task is to take the  𝑘
k
 -means code here and see what happens when you change the value of  𝑘
k
*What solution* , if any, do you find most compelling? 
The most compelling solution to me seems to be with K=4, as it looks to be be best cluster configuration.

Does complexity start to become an issue with this data set? 
Yes, when the K value gets high, it looks very indiscernable.

Finding out how to plot the centroid in each of the diagrams would be a great way to determine the best K fit.

Play around a bit and write up your findings and your process to share with your mentor. Keep in mind that it may be possible to have a solution with more than two clusters that is still better at tracking the real binary outcome – two of those clusters may map to "heart disease" while the other maps to "no heart disease," for example.
