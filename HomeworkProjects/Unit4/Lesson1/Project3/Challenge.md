#### Unit 4 - Lesson 1 - Project 3  
For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

1.  Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease  
    1. Supervised - as the indicators would be known
    1. Unsupervised - in which case the symptoms would no be known
1.  Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
    1. Unsupervised learning - we don't know what we're viewing
1.  An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
    1.  Unsupervised learning - since we need to define what "power users" means, we are not able to classify them
1.  That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
    1.  Unsupervised learning - We don't have a label to put on the consumers to figure out the parameters
1.  You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
    1. Unsupervised learning - you do not know which variables are critical
