    "\n",

    "####  Third: Model your outcome of interest. You should try several different approaches and really work to tune a variety of models before using the model evaluation techniques to choose what you consider to be the best performer. Make sure to think about explanatory versus predictive power and experiment with both.  \n",

    "1. Any weak points or shortcomings of your model  \n",

    "This presentation is not a drill. You'll be presenting this slide deck live to a group as the culmination of your work in the last two supervised learning units. As a secondary matter, your slides and / or the Jupyter notebook you use or adapt them into should be worthy of inclusion as examples of your work product when applying to jobs.\n",
