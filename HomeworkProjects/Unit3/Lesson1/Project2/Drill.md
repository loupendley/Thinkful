##### Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.  

1. Classify customer purchases into the categories:  
    1. Groceries
    1. Dining out
    1. Utilities
    1. Entertainment
1. Is the consumer credit going up
1. Are they increasing their dining out, and entertainment expenses?
1. Are the payment amounts consistent?
1. Are they paying on time?
1. Are they paying more for dining out and entertainment than the payment?
1. When are they scheduled to payoff the balance given their recent payment patterns?
